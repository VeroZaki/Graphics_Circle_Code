# Graphics_Circle_Code

## Concept

From the graphical view that the circle can be drawn by knowing only 1/8 of the circle so in this project we get the the whole circle coordinations by applying the Mid-point algorithm to the mid-point of the circle then we get the 1/4 of the circle coordinations believing in the mathematical theory which says "The cicle in maths is 1/4 circle and the rest 3/4 is the repetion of the 1/4 by swaping the cordinates and the signs"
